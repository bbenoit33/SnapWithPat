            <p>I became a Christian at the age of 18 but that doesn’t mean I’ve spent my adult life perfectly balancing my career and my faith. I’ll be the first to admit at times it’s truly tough to live out your faith in the workplace and use your career to further God’s kingdom. But it is possible when you put God first and trust him with your career decisions.</p>
            <p>When I was 28 years old I had the opportunity to take a director level position in which I was managing people who were the same age as my parents. It was a demanding position that quickly taught me I might sometimes have to make decisions other people don’t agree with. I was asked to terminate an employee just because a supervisor didn’t like him. It was a HR violation and I wouldn’t do it. That’s still one of the toughest decisions I had to make, but confirmed that God had put me in this high-level position because he believed I could do it. So I needed to trust his faith in me. That meant putting God first and making Biblically based decisions in the workplace.</p>
            <p>It worked. At MCI, I was one of the youngest recruitment managers, bringing in people of 27 different languages to work in a call center. By the time I decided to launch my own business, I became one of the youngest HR consultants in the Charleston area.</p>
            <p>With a newfound level of determination and God’s guidance, I’ve been able to align my work with God’s plan and his kingdom. Anything I’ve set my mind to I was able to accomplish because I was obedient. It’s about making that shift toward listening to God’s call on your life and how it aligns with your career. </p>
            <p>I’m eager to walk you through the process of shifting your work and shifting your world. I’ll ask some tough questions. I’ll share some hard truths. But that’s what it means to move into a new area of growth both professionally and spiritually. </p>
            <p>Now, let’s get started shifting your strategies and moving you to a place of balance.</p>
